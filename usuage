How to Use the Project in Kali Linux
Follow these steps to run and test the SIEM simulation.

Clone and Prepare:

git clone <your-github-repo>
cd siem-simulation-tool
Create the logs directory: mkdir logs
Start ELK Stack:

Run Docker Compose: sudo docker-compose up -d
Wait 1-2 minutes for services to start. Check status: sudo docker-compose ps
Verify:
Elasticsearch: Open http://localhost:9200 in browser (should show cluster info).
Kibana: Open http://localhost:5601 (login not required if security disabled).
Generate Logs:

Run the Python script: python3 log_generator.py
This creates logs/security_logs.log with 100 sample entries.
Ingest Logs via Logstash:

Logs are automatically ingested as they're written (Logstash monitors the file).
Check Elasticsearch: curl -X GET "localhost:9200/_cat/indices?v" (should show security-logs-* indices).
Visualize in Kibana:

Go to http://localhost:5601.
Create an index pattern: Go to Management > Stack Management > Index Patterns > Create index pattern. Enter security-logs-* and select @timestamp as time field.
Build a dashboard:
Go to Analytics > Dashboard > Create dashboard.
Add visualizations:
Pie Chart: Severity levels (group by severity).
Bar Chart: Events by source (group by source).
Data Table: Recent logs (filter by high severity).
Map: Geolocation of IPs (if you add geoip filter in Logstash).
Save the dashboard as "SIEM Overview".
Example Query: In Discover, search for severity:high to filter alerts.
Simulate Real-Time Monitoring:

Run python3 log_generator.py again to add more logs.
Refresh Kibana to see updates.
Test queries: e.g., Aggregate failed logins by IP.
Stop and Clean Up:

sudo docker-compose down
Remove volumes if needed: sudo docker volume rm siem-simulation-tool_esdata
